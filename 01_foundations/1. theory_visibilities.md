# Theory: Visibilities in Radio Interferometry

This note develops the concept of **visibility** from first principles and clarifies
what is *actually measured* by a radio interferometer.  
The goal is not formal derivation alone, but physical and interpretive understanding.

---

## 1. What Does a Radio Interferometer Measure?

A radio interferometer does **not** measure an image of the sky directly.  
Instead, each pair of antennas measures a complex quantity called a **visibility**.

At a given time and observing frequency, a single baseline samples **one spatial
frequency component** of the sky brightness distribution.

> **Key idea:**  
> An interferometer measures *correlations*, not images.

---

## 2. Sky Brightness Distribution

Let  
\[
T(l,m)
\]
denote the sky brightness distribution, where:

- \( l, m \) are direction cosines (small-angle approximation),
- \( T(l,m) \) has units of specific intensity (or flux density per solid angle).

### Assumptions (Explicit)

The standard interferometric measurement equation assumes:

1. **Incoherent radiation**
2. **Far-field sources**
3. **Small field of view** (flat sky approximation)
4. **Monochromatic observation**

These assumptions will be relaxed in more advanced treatments, but they are sufficient
for foundational understanding.

## 3. Definition of Visibility

The complex visibility \( V(u,v) \) is defined as:

\[
V(u,v) = \iint T(l,m)\, e^{-i2\pi(ul + vm)} \, dl \, dm
\]

where:

- \( u, v \) are baseline coordinates measured in **wavelengths**,
- \( (u,v) \) represent spatial frequencies in the Fourier domain.

This relation follows from the **van Cittert–Zernike theorem**.

> **Interpretation:**  
> A visibility is a Fourier component of the sky brightness.

---

## 4. Inverse Relation

Formally, the sky brightness can be written as:

\[
T(l,m) = \iint V(u,v)\, e^{+i2\pi(ul + vm)} \, du \, dv
\]

However, this expression hides a crucial problem:

> **In practice, \( V(u,v) \) is only sampled at discrete and incomplete locations.**

This is the origin of the imaging problem in radio interferometry.

---

## 5. Physical Meaning of Amplitude and Phase

Each visibility is a **complex number**:

\[
V(u,v) = |V(u,v)| e^{i\phi(u,v)}
\]

- **Amplitude**  
  Measures *how much* power exists at a given spatial frequency.
- **Phase**  
  Encodes *where* structures are located on the sky.

### Key Insight

- Amplitudes alone cannot reconstruct spatial structure.
- Phases carry most of the positional information.

> Losing phase information destroys image fidelity far more severely than losing amplitude.

---

## 6. Zero Spacing and Total Flux

At zero baseline:

\[
V(0,0) = \iint T(l,m)\, dl\, dm
\]

This equals the **total flux density** of the source.

### Consequence

- Interferometers **cannot measure absolute total flux** unless very short baselines
  or single-dish data are available.
- Missing short spacings directly affect sensitivity to large-scale structures.

---

## 7. Hermitian Symmetry

Because the sky brightness \( T(l,m) \) is real:

\[
V(-u,-v) = V^*(u,v)
\]

This means:

- Each baseline measurement implicitly provides **two Fourier samples**.
- The Fourier plane has Hermitian symmetry.

---

## 8. Why Each Visibility Contains Global Information

A common misconception:

> “A visibility at \((u,v)\) corresponds to a particular region of the image.”

This is false.

Because Fourier basis functions are **global**, each visibility contributes information
to *every pixel* in the reconstructed image.

### Implication

- Missing or corrupted visibilities affect the **entire image**, not a localized region.
- Imaging artifacts are global, not local.

---

## 9. Discrete Sampling of the Fourier Plane

In reality, the measured visibility function is:

\[
V_{\text{obs}}(u,v) = S(u,v)\, V(u,v)
\]

where \( S(u,v) \) is the **sampling function**, equal to 1 where data exist and 0 elsewhere.

This leads directly to:

- Incomplete Fourier coverage
- Convolution effects in image space
- The appearance of the **dirty beam**

These consequences are explored in subsequent theory notes and experiments.

---

## 10. Conceptual Summary

- Visibilities are **Fourier components**, not image pixels.
- Sampling is incomplete and irregular.
- Imaging is therefore an **inverse problem**, not a simple Fourier inversion.
- Any reconstructed image necessarily reflects **assumptions beyond the data**.

---

## 11. Looking Ahead

This understanding sets the stage for:

- Dirty images and dirty beams
- Weighting schemes in the \((u,v)\) plane
- Deconvolution algorithms (CLEAN, multi-scale CLEAN)
- Bayesian and sparse reconstruction methods

The next note builds directly on this foundation:
**`incomplete_sampling.md`**
